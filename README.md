# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my first attempt at analyzing Netflix data! This project is an exploration into the rich world of Netflix shows and movies, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using data science and visualization techniques.

## Project Overview
Netflix has revolutionized the way we consume media, offering a vast library of diverse content. In this project, I explored into a dataset containing information about the shows and movies available on Netflix. The analysis covers various aspects such as release years, countries of origin, and the type of content (movies vs TV shows).

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is derived from a publicly available source that includes details about the titles available on Netflix from Kaggle Website.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment for running Python code and presenting the analysis.

## Key Findings
- An upward trend in the number of titles added over time, with a peak observed in 2017 - 2019.
- A breakdown of the distribution between movies and TV shows.
- Identification of the top 10 countries contributing to Netflix's content library.

## Challenges Faced
This being my first attempt, I encountered several challenges, including data cleaning, dealing with missing values, and learning how to effectively visualize time-series data. Each challenge was an opportunity to learn and improve my coding and data analysis skills.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I've gained valuable insights into the world of data analysis and the media streaming landscape. This is just the beginning, and I look forward to refining my techniques and uncovering more fascinating stories hidden within the data.

## Future Work (if I can obtain relevant datasets)
In future iterations of this project, I plan to:
- Conduct sentiment analysis on viewer reviews.
- Explore content recommendation based on user preferences.
- Analyze the impact of new content on subscriber growth.

Thank you for visiting my project. Feel free to reach out and/or comment on my work. :)
